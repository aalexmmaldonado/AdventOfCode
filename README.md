<h1 align="center">Advent of Code ðŸŽ„</h1>

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository!
Each year, I want to participate in this coding challenge to grow as a programmer, explore new languages, and tackle fun and creative problems.
This repository is where I document my journey, solutions, and motivations for each year.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th.
Every day, a new puzzle is released, and participants from all over the world use their skills to solve these problems in their favorite programming languages.

## Motivation by Year

-   **2024: Becoming Comfortable with Rust ðŸ¦€**

    This year, my goal is to become more proficient and comfortable with Rust.
    While I deeply enjoy working with Python, Iâ€™ve started to feel constrained by its performance limitations, especially in my computational biology research where speed can be a critical factor.
    Rustâ€™s emphasis on safety, performance, and control makes it an excellent complement to Python for high-performance tasks.

    Additionally, I believe WebAssembly has incredible potential as a platform for distributing scientific tools.
    Rustâ€™s strong support for WebAssembly positions it as a powerful language for building efficient, portable solutions.
    Through Advent of Code, I hope to not only improve my skills in Rust but also explore its potential to overcome challenges in my research and development work.
