<h1 align="center">Advent of Code 🎄</h1>

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository!
Each year, I want to participate in this coding challenge to grow as a programmer, explore new languages, and tackle fun and creative problems.
This repository is where I document my journey, solutions, and motivations for each year.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming challenge that starts on December 1st.
Every day, a new puzzle is released, and participants from all over the world use their skills to solve these problems in their favorite programming languages.

## Motivation by Year

**25: Refreshing Rust 🦀**

After a year dedicated primarily to teaching and curriculum development in Python, I am using this year’s Advent of Code to re-immerse myself in Rust.
While Python is fantastic for the classroom, my "borrow checker" intuition has gotten a little rusty.
My goal this year is to shake off the cobwebs, shift my mindset back from high-level scripting to systems-level performance, and sharpen the skills I need for my upcoming research software projects.

**24: Becoming Comfortable with Rust 🦀**

This year, my goal is to become more proficient and comfortable with Rust.
While I deeply enjoy working with Python, I’ve started to feel constrained by its performance limitations, especially in my computational biology research where speed can be a critical factor.
Rust’s emphasis on safety, performance, and control makes it an excellent complement to Python for high-performance tasks.
